# Anna Belkania 

### I've been fascinated with computers ever since my dad bought one, and my curiosity about how they work led me to explore programming.
###I started learning independently and furthered my skills by participating in the free course at GEO Lab in 2021, as part of the Front-end Girls project by UNDP. It was there that I discovered my passion for web development. I enjoy building websites and find joy in the creativity and problem-solving involved. A key point is that I appreciate roles where I can focus on tasks without too much direct communication with people.
